# TODOs

(1) Depending on the situation sometimes we are not able to add a package unless the package name (com.acme.package) is provided, whereas at other times the path/URL is enough. This should be correctly signalled to the user.
Or just go with the slow and clunky approach

(2) Even with UPM 2020 we still could probably not run package ops while unity is already compiling or importing assets.
