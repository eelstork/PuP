## Git URLs

Here is a sample Git URL; the following works if the package.json
is at the root of the target repository.

https://github.com/unity3d-jp/UnityChanSpringBone.git

Now here is a sample git URL in case the package.json is inside Assets/pkgname (this case is common too!)

https://github.example.com/myuser/myrepository.git?path=/subfolder1
